ConnectFour 🎮
This project is a Connect Four game implemented in Irvine 32 x86 assembly language. It was developed as part of the 3rd Semester COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language) course project.

Description ℹ️
Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent does.
